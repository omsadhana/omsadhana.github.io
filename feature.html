Hence the value of cleanliness is taken care of from our home, TPM Nagar.  This experience will definitely facilitate an attitude of Social Service and Patriotism.  Moreover, we give messages to all parents to identify at least 10 useless things at home and to discard them.  We are happy there are enthusiastic parents who follow suit and inform us regarding the number of things identified and discarded.  We mention just ten but such enthusiastic parents are able to identify multiples of ten useless things and discard them accordingly.  We believe that if every home is kept clean, if every neighbourhood  is  kept clean , India becomes clean ultimately.  Clean India is Healthy India, Healthy India is a Strong India, A Strong India is a Powerful India,  A Powerful India is a Developed India.</p>
